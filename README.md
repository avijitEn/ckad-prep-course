In this Course, your instructor Srikumar Krishnamurthy, covers each modules defined in the [CKAD exam curriculum](https://www.cncf.io/certification/ckad/) with primary focus on the hands on lab for better time management during the exam. Also there are interactive labs / quiz that will be available at [Katacoda scenarios by Srikumar Krishnamurth author of Containers and Cloud](https://www.katacoda.com/csquare). By end of this course you would have practiced different scenarios which will help you gain hands on knowledge on Kubernetes and as well gain speed for the CKAD exam.

During the exam, you are allowed to keep only one other browser tab open to refer kubernetes official documentation. I am also including the bookmark I used during my exam and will be referring during the solution video as required.
